# Description
A bady optimized portable OpenRCT plugin package manager written in python.  
The script gets all the plugins from the   
https://openrct2plugins.org/  
website mostly by web-scraping.  
Right now i working on a new version, so you can look forward to that.  

# Install
First you need to download python and the python dependency  
```pip install beautifulsoup4 ```  
Then get the script from  
[Codeberg Releases](https://codeberg.org/marvin1099/OpenRCT-Plugin-PM/releases)  
or get it from  
[Github Releases](https://github.com/marvin1099/OpenRCT-Plugin-PM/releases)  
Put the ```orct-cmd-plugin-dl.py``` in the openrct plugin folder  
Then run ```orct-cmd-plugin-dl.py``` inside the "openrct plugin folder"  
It is important that you run the script with the "openrct plugin folder" as working directory.  
This is so that the plugins and the config file all get written to the plugin folder.  
You can do this by openning a terminal inside the "openrct plugin folder".  
You can also open a terminal, type ```cd "openrct plugin folder path"``` and then run the file.  
For windows open the cmd and the cd command might need a /d, so ```cd /d "openrct plugin folder path"```.
